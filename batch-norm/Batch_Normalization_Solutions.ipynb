    "5. When training, we use `tf.nn.moments` to calculate the batch mean and variance. Then we update the population statistics and use `tf.nn.batch_normalization` to normalize the layer's output using the batch statistics. Notice the `with tf.control_dependencies...` statement - this is required to force TensorFlow to run the operations that update the population statistics.\n",
